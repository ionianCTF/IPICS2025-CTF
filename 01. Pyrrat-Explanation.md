This TryHackMe "Pyrat" challenge is a great learning opportunity for beginners to understand the foundational stages of penetration testing. The first step involves reconnaissance using Nmap, a tool that reveals important information such as open ports and running services. In this case, two ports were identified: an SSH service and a Python-based web server. While automated tools like directory fuzzers initially failed to find useful information, manually interacting with the server using Netcat revealed a critical vulnerability — the server was executing raw Python code received over TCP. This scenario teaches students the importance of manual testing and creative thinking when automation doesn't yield results.

Netcat (nc) is often called the “Swiss army knife” of networking. It allows users to send data over TCP or UDP connections. In this case, it was used to manually test the behavior of the service on port 8000. The discovery that Python code could be executed revealed a critical misconfiguration.

A reverse shell is a way to control a compromised system. It reverses the typical client-server direction by having the target connect back to the attacker’s listener. In this case, Python’s socket and pty modules were used to make the shell interactive.

The next learning focus is on exploitation and post-exploitation. The ability to execute Python code remotely was leveraged to send a reverse shell payload, allowing the attacker to remotely control the system. Once inside, the attacker enumerated the file system and discovered a hidden .git directory containing plaintext credentials. This demonstrates the real-world risk of poor development practices, such as storing secrets in version-controlled repositories. Learners understand the significance of file system inspection, and how leaked credentials can be used to escalate access — in this case, through SSH login.

Finally, the challenge emphasizes privilege escalation, a crucial phase in any attack. By recovering a deleted Python file (likely through enumeration or forensics techniques), the attacker gains root-level access and retrieves the final flag. This part of the walkthrough shows how persistence, creativity, and technical knowledge can uncover hidden paths to system compromise. It also teaches defenders to securely manage sensitive files, apply least-privilege principles, and monitor for unexpected behaviors. Overall, the challenge is an end-to-end lesson in ethical hacking, from initial scanning to full system compromise.


## 1. Nmap Scanning

**What was done:**  
The attacker used Nmap with the flags `-sC -sV` to scan the target and detect open ports, services, and their versions.

**Explanation:**  
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used to discover services and vulnerabilities on a remote machine. The `-sC` flag runs default scripts (for enumeration), and `-sV` detects service versions. This method helps ethical hackers understand what services are running and whether they may be exploitable.

**Educational value:**  
This step teaches how to perform **initial reconnaissance**, which is the foundation of penetration testing. It shows students how to identify the **“attack surface”** of a target.

## 2. Netcat for Manual Interaction

**What was done:**  
After discovering port 8000, the attacker connected to it using Netcat and found that it was accepting and executing Python code.

**Explanation:**  
Netcat (`nc`) is often called the “Swiss army knife” of networking. It allows users to send data over TCP or UDP connections. In this case, it was used to manually test the behavior of the service on port 8000. The discovery that Python code could be executed revealed a **critical misconfiguration**.

**Educational value:**  
This teaches the value of **manual probing** when automated tools don’t provide results. It emphasizes **testing for dangerous behaviors** such as insecure code execution, which mimics real-world developer mistakes.

## 3. Reverse Shell Execution

**What was done:**  
A Python one-liner reverse shell was sent through Netcat, giving the attacker a shell back to their machine.

**Explanation:**  
A **reverse shell** is a way to control a compromised system. It reverses the typical client-server direction by having the target connect back to the attacker's listener. In this case, Python’s `socket` and `pty` modules were used to make the shell interactive.

**Educational value:**  
Students learn how **remote code execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities can be weaponized and why it's important to **restrict unvalidated input** in applications.

## 4. Enumeration & Credential Discovery

**What was done:**  
Once inside, the attacker explored the file system and found user credentials in a `.git` folder in `/opt/dev/`.

**Explanation:**  
**Enumeration** is the process of gathering deeper information from a compromised machine. Git directories often contain commit history and configuration files that can reveal secrets if not properly secured.

**Educational value:**  
This highlights the importance of **post-exploitation enumeration** and teaches students to look for overlooked files and directories that might contain **credentials, tokens, or secrets**.

## 5. SSH Access Using Stolen Credentials

**What was done:**  
The attacker used the credentials from the `.git` directory to log in via SSH.

**Explanation:**  
**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a secure protocol used for remote system access. By logging in with valid credentials, the attacker gained a more **stable and persistent shell** than the reverse shell.

**Educational value:**  
This teaches how **credential reuse** can be exploited and stresses the need for **secure credential storage and management** in development environments.

---

## 6. File Recovery & Privilege Escalation

**What was done:**  
The attacker found and restored a deleted Python file, which helped them escalate privileges to `root`.

**Explanation:**  
**Privilege escalation** involves gaining higher access levels than initially granted. Deleted files can sometimes be recovered or reconstructed. In this scenario, the attacker likely used clues or tools to access the contents of a previously available script.

**Educational value:**  
This shows the importance of **forensic techniques** and **system enumeration** in privilege escalation, as well as teaching defenders to **monitor file access and deletion activities**.
